# Pinochle

A webserver implementation of the card game [Pinochle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinochle) in Elixir.  There are
many variations of this game.  I'm implementing the rules used by my family.

I created this project as a forcing function to extend my knowledge and experience of the Elixir ecosystem:
- GenServers
- (Dynamic) Supervisors
- Phoenix
- LiveView
- Deployments (maybe)

I'm not planning to add a database.  In memory data is fine for this context.

I don't expect this to receive any widespread usage.  If you want to play Pinochle online, there are plenty of existing
websites.
